# DeepWork-Factor-Tracker

## Author

This project was created by Edvarda Tomter (https://github.com/edvartom).

## Background story
Tom is an old fictive man who likes to **study**. He has noticed that he, at seemingly random occations, falls into a flow of concentration, experiencing that concentrating deeply feels easy. This can happen while he is thinking at his studies, when taking a walk, or when he concentrates on something he is doing, like detailed woodworking. He calls moments of deep concentration **deep work sessions** after the book "Deep Work" by Cal Newport\*. Tom wants to check wether these sessions depend on hes sleep at night among other factors. He starts to log some key factors from his sleep every night, as well as some some other factors around his deep work sessions.  

## What does the code do?
This programming project is made in order to plot factors related to Tom's deep work sessions against each other. This spesific task is done in the **"main.jl"**-file. The file "change-data.jl" can be used for making new random data related to Tom's deep work sessions.

## How to test the program
### Installation
* Install Julia.
* Install the packages "Dates" and "Plots".
* If you want to generate new data in tom_sessions_data, install package "Distributions".

### How to run the code
* Run "main.jl".
* Follow the instructions given in the terminal.
* If you want to generate new data in "tom_sessions_data", run "change-data.jl".
